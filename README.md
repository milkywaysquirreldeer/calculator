# calculator

A JavaScript-based calculator built as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations) web development curriculum.

It can be viewed live at https://milkywaysquirreldeer.github.io/calculator using a desktop browser.*

*Please note that it is not tested against mobile browsers, as the project focus is on JavaScript fundamentals (responsive design comes later in the curriculum).

The Calculator project prompt can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-calculator).
